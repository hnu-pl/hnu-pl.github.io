We study programming languages (more generally, formal languages) to seek better approaches to constructing software systems through precise understanding of foundational concepts in computing. Often times, ideas in computing are described as source code in some programming language syntax. If you seek to precisely understand how such an idea is executed inside a specific machine, you would need to understand the translation from that code into the low-level machine language, which is automated by compilers most of the time in day-to-day practice. If you seek to derive general principles of that idea, you would try to understand the code by modeling it via an abstract formal language, such as logic or certain mathematical structure. It is a repeating pattern that problems in computing often involves formally relating one programming language to another. Hope you would also be amused to discover this recurring problem-solving pattern, which arises in various aspects of computing from pragmatics to theories.
